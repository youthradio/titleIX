				<p>If you are a student who has experienced sexual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.knowyourix.org/high-school-resource/title-ix/">violence or harassment</a>, you may have the right to seek support and justice through your school under Title IX. But unfortunately, many schools are not in compliance with Title IX's requirements. <a target="_blank" href="https://youthradio.org/">Over the past three years, there has been a sixfold increase in federal investigations into K-12 schools for the way they handle sexual assault claims.</a></p>
				
				<i>Take a moment to read through these scenarios and select the way you think your school would respond. You might be surprised with the rights guaranteed to you by Title IX.</i>

			Actually, federal law <a target='_blank' href='https://www.justice.gov/crt/federal-coordination-and-compliance-section-152'>requires schools to look into sexual harassment and assault</a>, which both fall under Title IX, a law most commonly associated with women's access to sports. Title IX has been around since the 1970's, but in recent years it has been increasingly applied to sexual assault. Under Title IX, schools may even be accountable for off-campus assaults.</p>">Encourage the student to tell the police or connect to outside resources, but not investigate the matter personally -- the school staff care about students, but it's not their role to investigate these matters.</button>

			Nice! It sounds like your school is on-track for this particular requirement. Every school is supposed to have a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.justice.gov/crt/federal-coordination-and-compliance-section-152'>Title IX Coordinator</a>. They are responsible for making sure students are aware of their Title IX rights, and that your school is in compliance with the law.
